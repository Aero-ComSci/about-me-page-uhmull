            <p>Hi! My name is <b style="color: darkblue;">Amulya Medarametla</b> and I am a current 9th grader at
                Emerald
                High School. I aim to graduate from high school with straight A's and take AP courses. I am currently
                enrolled in Emerald High School's computer science essentials course and plan to take AP Computer
                Science
                Principles and AP Computer Science Applications in the years to come. I am planning on going to a four-year
                university, and I am aiming for an UC. I have goals to major in computer science while also taking a business-related
                course
                as a minor. After I finish undergrad, I am planning on getting a Master in Business Associations
                degree.
                In the future, I want to start my very own business, something I have been dreaming of since I was 11.
            </p>
            <p>
                Three positive character traits of mine are being <strong style="color: darkgreen;">compassionate, calm,
                    and
                    quirky</strong>. I currently have more than <b style="color: rgb(121, 1, 1);">50</b> volunteer
                hours
                and have experience in tutoring little kids. My favorite pastimes are the Science Olympiad Club and the
                Scholastic Art and Writing Club! I am vice president of the Emerald High School's Science Olympiad club
                and
                I am treasurer of Emerald High School's Scholastic Art and Writing club. Both of these clubs are a huge
                and
                amazing part of my day! I also started a club with my best friend in middle school. From this club, I was
                able to learn a lot of leadership skills that are necessary for the workforce and leadership positions
                in
                general.
            </p>
            <p> The best way to contact me for educational purposes would be to email using this email address:
                <b style= "color: darkred;">medarametla5325@mydsud.org</b> From future projects I was a part of, I found that emailing me is the best
                way
                to contact me about school, work, club, or event related matters. Currently, in the Scholastic Arts in
                Writing club, I and two other board members are planning a district-wide writing contest with an awards
                ceremony and a question and answer session with a local poet. This event is still under the planning
                phase
                however it has taught me many useful things. For example, I already emailed the person controlling
                Dublin
                High School's Performing Arts Center to check the availability of the building for an event. </p>
