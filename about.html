      <p style="text-indent: 20px;"> Throughout my life, I have always been intrigued by the technological state of the world. Ever since I was a little kid, I would watch my parents code intricate websites. As a child, I have always wanted to code a website like my parents and tried learning how to code with my mom in sixth grade. While I learned some useful HTML tags during this process, I was not able to create basic websites without the help of others. When I started selected courses for highschool in eigth grade and saw that I could take courses from the computer science pathway, I immidately selected CSE to be my elective. I plan to continue my journey through the Computer Science pathways in the following school years by taking AP CSP in tenth grade and AP CSA in eleventh grade. Currently, I'm just days away from entirely finishing the CSE course, along with my freshman year of high school. </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 20px;">I believe throughout the course, I have learned to code in HTML, Python, a little CSS and MIT App Inventor. In the class we have also explored sprints and how they are predominant within the computer science industry. I was able to practice doing a handful of very small sprints when working on 1.1.6, which was a free choice project with a partner. I and my partner used sprints to successfully create a Flappy Bird game on MIT app inventor. Another project where sprints significantly improved the quality of our code we were able to produce was the entrepreneurship project. In this project, we were able to efficiently use our time during class in order to create a study schedule maker (which even went on to proceed to the showcase for this competition). I can not wait to use sprints at an actual computer science office job in a decade.</p>
