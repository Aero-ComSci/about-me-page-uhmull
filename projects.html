      <td style="text-align: left; text-indent: 20px;">This was a CSE project which was made using MIT App Inventor. This was a free choice project where I got to experiment using SCRUM for my very first time. This application was inspired by the very addictive yet big hit game called "Flappy Bird". I worked on this project with a partner from October 20th, 2023 to November 3rd, 2023 in order to gain experience on creating fun yet simple to code stress-reducing games. For this project, me and my partner used sprints in order to assign tasks to each person in order to efficently produce our product and as a result we advanced our collaboration skills to the next level. My role in this project was improving the aesthetics of this project by developing and improving the UI for the app. I was also the tester after me and partner finished our sprints, allowing me to not only learn how SCRUM works but also gaining experience on having multiple different roles. This is a key project in my coding journey because it allowed me to gain exposure and minor experience with the SCRUM process. Learning SCRUM comes in handy when entering the software industry or/and working on a group project. Not only is it used everywhere in the industry, but it also allows work to get done efficently and eliminates the time for other things such as TikTok, Youtube and the most guility culprit of them all, procrastination. A big challenge that I faced as the UI developer for this project was being able to rotate the pillars upside down in MIT app inventor. While I never figured out how to rotate these pillars, I downloaded a pre-rotated version of the pillars and used those instead. </td>
      <td style="text-align: left; text-indent: 20px;">Smart Study is a group project I helped create in CSE. Smart Study aims to revolutionize the schedule making industry. Smart Study is an application that catters to student's number one stressor in high school: grades. Unlike Smart Study, major study schedule creating applications don't create schedules based on the student's grade in the class and how many days until the next upcoming test. In this project, I was both the UI developer and was responsible for creating a working login and signup page. I learned a lot of new skills in this project, such as how to use firebase for authorization and for hosting databases. For this project, I also ended up learning a little bit of javascript as well. A huge obstacle that Smart Study faced was a few days before the project was due. At the time, our final display screen (which show's the user their personalized study schedule) kept displaying an atypical cookie. At first we were very confused on what the string was, but after a little help from Mr. Baez, our CSE teacher, we became aware that the funky string was a cookie and strived to fix the issue (the issue has been fixed). This project entailed for massive amounts of teamwork and collaboration that would soar out of the roof due to the short time span we had for the project. I started this project on April 10th and finished the project on May 17th. With our intense collaboration and use of our unique skills, we were able to create a demo version of our product which got voted to procede to the Dublin Engineering and Design Academy's showcase on May 24th.</td>
